# economic-freedom
A bunch of projects related to data on the Index of Economic Freedom, published by the Heritage Foundation.

The first (and thusfar only) completed project looks at average daily COVID-19 test positivity rates from January 2020 to April 2021 across countries, and whether countries higher or lower on the Index of Economic Freedom have higher or lower average daily TPRs.
